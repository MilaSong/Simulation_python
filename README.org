* Report
** TODO Describe the q-learning and DQL model (pros. cons. and why I’m not using it for the simulation)
** TODO A2C algorithm (probably gonna be used in the program)
** TODO NN backpropogation calculations
** TODO NN performance comparison with Keras or scikit-learn
* Q-Learning example
  Example to understand q-learning algorithm. The problem was found in the article: https://blog.valohai.com/reinforcement-learning-tutorial-part-1-q-learning

** Program usage
In the problem, agent learns to find the most valuable position by using q-learning algorithm.

** Decay
Exponential decay function was used to decrease agent’s chances of exploring (gambling).
* Neural network
